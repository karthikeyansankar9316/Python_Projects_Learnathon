#Task tracker
This is a project used to track and manage your tasks. In this task, I build a simple command line interface (CLI) to track what you need to do, what you have done, and what you are currently working on. This project will help you practice your programming skills, including working with the filesystem, handling user inputs, and building a simple CLI application.

The list of commands and their usage is given below:

# Adding a new task
task-cli add "Buy groceries"
# Output: Task added successfully (ID: 1)

# Updating and deleting tasks
task-cli update 1 "Buy groceries and cook dinner"
task-cli delete 1

# Marking a task as in progress or done
task-cli mark-in-progress 1
task-cli mark-done 1

# Listing all tasks
task-cli list

# Listing tasks by status
task-cli list done
task-cli list todo
task-cli list in-progress
Task Properties
Each task should have the following properties:

id: A unique identifier for the task
description: A short description of the task
status: The status of the task (todo, in-progress, done)
createdAt: The date and time when the task was created
updatedAt: The date and time when the task was last updated
